Fabienbk's ScalaJS facade to Pixi.js
====================================

[![Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/assets/badges/scalajs-0.6.8.svg)](https://www.scala-js.org)

This project aims to provide a ScalaJS facade for [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/), a 2D library
that works across all devices.  Pixi.js has full
[WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) support and seamlessly falls back
to HTML5's [canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element) if needed. It's
quite awesome, and ScalaJS makes it awesomer.

The goal of this project is to stay as close as possible to the underlying API, in order words,
to favor correctness over abstraction.

### Live Demo

Go to http://asteroids.fbksoft.com and shoot some rocks!

### Version

It's currently targeting *Pixi.js v4.0.3*. Don't forget to include it in your project.

### Installation ###

Once you've setup your ScalaJS project, simply add this to your dependencies:

```scala
    libraryDependencies += "com.fbksoft" %%% "pixi-scala-js" % "1.0"
```

### How to get started ###

A good starting import configuration could be:

```scala
import pixiscalajs.PIXI
import pixiscalajs.PIXI.{Pixi, RendererOptions}
```

This way, you can use `PIXI.*` prefixed references, which is very common in
pixi.js documentation and snippets. Very often, you can almost copy-paste normal js code,
remove the trailing semicolons, and be done!

Note: To avoid name-clashing with scala package, the global `PIXI` JS object is mapped to
a `Pixi` (different casing) scala object. It's mostly useful to call the `autoDetectRenderer` method.

Here is a small example:

```scala
@JSExportTopLevel
def main(canvas: html.Canvas): Unit = {
  val renderer = Pixi.autoDetectRenderer(800, 600, RendererOptions(canvas))

  val stage = new PIXI.Container()
  stage.width = 800
  stage.height = 600

  val graphics = new PIXI.Graphics()
  graphics.beginFill(0xFF3300).lineStyle(10, 0xffd900, 1)
  graphics.moveTo(50,50).lineTo(250, 50).lineTo(100, 100)
          .lineTo(250, 220).lineTo(50, 220).lineTo(50, 50)
  graphics.endFill()

  stage.addChild(graphics)

  renderer.render(stage)
}
```

#### Extensions ####

##### Animation Loops #####

The `pixiscalajs.extensions` package contains various extensions to the library
designed to make the library more scala-friendly.

The `AnimationLoop` construct allows to defined an endless loop that automatically calls
 `window.requestAnimationFrame` at the end.

```scala
import pixiscalajs.extensions.AnimationLoop

AnimationLoop {  
  ...  
  sprite.rotation += 0.1
  ...
  renderer.render(stage)
}
```
Note that this will start the loop immediately. If you want to control the start, use `DefineLoop` :

```scala
import pixiscalajs.extensions.DefineLoop

val loop = DefineLoop {  
  ...  
  sprite.rotation += 0.1
  ...
  renderer.render(stage)
}

loop.run()
```

##### Vector2 implementation #####

`pixiscalajs.extensions.Vector2` is a `PIXI.Point` implicitly-convertible Vector 2D implementation, with some common function and operators (arithmetic, magnitude, etc.).

##### Keyboard Bindings #####

```scala
  import pixiscalajs.extensions.Keyboard

  val right = Keyboard.bind(39)
  val left = Keyboard.bind(37)

  AnimationLoop {
    if (right.isDown) println("right arrow is pressed")
    if (left.isDown) println("left arrow is pressed")    
  }
```
